# UNESCO-Nassau
One of the oldest cities of the Americas, Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas, is located on the island of New Providence. The crafts and folk arts have drawn on this migration m√©lange to form a distinct culture, whilst showing clear kinship with the contributory streams. Bahamian cultural forms may thus be viewed as a bridge between the cultural complexes of the two regions.
